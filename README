Cosines Similarity over Tf-Idf Weighted Vectors (as User Defined Function for Pig Latin), by Victor S. Bursztyn [vbursztyn@gmail.com | vsb@poli.ufrj.br ].

*** REQUIREMENTS:

Make sure you have installed Pig. Successfully running Pig's first examples is highly recommendable, before attempting the further step.

*** USAGE:

1. CALCULATING COSINES SIMILARITY:

First, make sure "tfidf.csv" is placed at the same folder.

Usage in local mode is quite simple:
pig -x local cosines-tfidf.pig

After you run it a new folder "cossim-results.csv" will be created, storing the output.

2. TESTING FROM ECLIPSE:

In order to test it with JUnit, open a project in Eclipse with the content of "CosinesUDF". Then run "CosinesTest.java" as a JUnit Test.
